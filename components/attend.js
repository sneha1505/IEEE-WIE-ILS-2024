                                The history of the city is as old as the epic Mahabharata. The town was known as
                                Indraprastha, where Pandavas used to live. In due course eight more cities came alive
                                adjacent to Indraprastha: Lal Kot, Siri, Dinpanah, Quila Rai Pithora, Ferozabad,
                                Jahanpanah,
                                Tughlakabad and Shahjahanabad.

                                Delhi has been a witness to the political turmoil for over five centuries. It was ruled
                                by
                                the Mughals in succession to Khiljis and Tughlaqs.

                                India GateIn 1192 the legions of the Afghan warrior Muhammad of Ghori captured the
                                Rajput
                                town, and the Delhi Sultanate was established (1206). The invasion of Delhi by Timur in
                                1398
                                put an end to the sultanate; the Lodis, last of the Delhi sultans, gave way to Babur,
                                who,
                                after the battle of Panipat in 1526, founded the Mughal Empire. The early Mughal
                                emperors
                                favoured Agra as their capital, and Delhi became their permanent seat only after Shah
                                Jahan
                                built (1638) the walls of Old Delhi.

                                From Hindu Kings to Muslim Sultans, the reins of the city kept shifting from one ruler
                                to
                                another. The soils of the city smell of blood, sacrifices and love for the nation. The
                                old
                                'Havelis' and edifices from the past stand silent but their silence also speaks volumes
                                for
                                their owners and people who lived here centuries back.

                                In the year 1803 AD, the city came under the British rule. In 1911, British shifted
                                their
                                capital from Calcutta to Delhi. It again became the center of all the governing
                                activities.
                                But, the city has the reputation of over throwing the occupants of its throne. It
                                included
                                the British and the current political parties that have had the honour of leading free
                                India.

                                After independence in 1947, New Delhi was officially declared as the Capital of India.
